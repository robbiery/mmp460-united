<!--3 Situations You May Find Yourself In With ICE
If approached by ICE agents, you have the right to remain silent and if they try to search you, you have the ability to not consent to a search. If you are detained/arrested:
You have the right to remain silent
You have the right to speak with an attorney
You have the right to ask for an interpreter 
You can make phone calls while detained and receive visitors

Note: Recording ICE agents may put you at risk, although you are allowed to record as long as you do not interfere with the officers

If ICE/immigration is at your door:
You have the right to remain silent and the right to keep your door closed. Ask to see their badge, ID, or business card, via a window, peephole, or by passing it under the door. Confirm that ICE has a judicial warrant for your location and person(s).
No warrant? You do not have to let them in or speak with them.
Yes to a warrant? You can ask them to slide it under the door—if it was signed by a judges you need to comply

If ICE/immigration enters your home (without permission):
You can tell them you do not consent to them being in your home and/or that you do not consent to them searching
Avoid any physical altercations with law enforcement
Note: Telling them you do not want them in your house may not stop them, but it can help with future legal cases

If ICE/immigration is at your workplace:
ICE can enter any public space of any workplace without needing any type of warrant, but they cannot legally enter private workplace areas (employee-only areas) unless they have a judicial warrant or permission from your employer. In an emergency (threat to someone’s life or public safety), ICE does not need your permission to enter. Remember that you always have the right to remain silent.
